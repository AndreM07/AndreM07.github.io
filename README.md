# **About Me**

- I first became interested in engineering during my freshman year of high school after taking my first engineering class. It was an introductory course where I learned the basics and foundations of engineering design.  
- I completed 4 years of engineering classes in high school, each focusing on a specific branch of engineering, such as mechanical, electrical, and coding.  
- I am currently pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois Chicago.  
- Beyond engineering, I have a strong interest in finance. Here is a short list of finance books I've read:  
  - **The Buy Side**  
  - **Liar's Poker**  
  - **Den of Thieves**  
  - **A Short History of Financial Euphoria**  
  - **Barbarians at the Gate**  
  - **The Big Short**  
  - **The Predator's Ball**

# **Engineering Projects**

### **1. SAE Wheel Hub Modeling (2024‚Äì)**  
- üå± **Description**:  
  - Collaborating with a group of 5 Senior Design students to design and create an SAE wheel hub.  
  - Conducted a patent search to research and brainstorm possible designs.  
  - Utilized SolidWorks to create an original wheel hub design that meets SAE standards.  
  - Uploaded the design into ANSYS to apply FEA (Finite Element Analysis).  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Skills Used**:  
  - ANSYS, Finite Element Analysis, SolidWorks.  

### **2. Ping Pong Ball Launcher (2022)**  
- üå± **Description**:  
  - Collaborated with a team of four students to design and build an autonomous ping-pong ball launcher using Arduino.  
  - Utilized SolidWorks to create individual 3D component models and three final prototype assemblies.  
  - Highlighted high-priority tasks in a Gantt chart, and work was distributed evenly.  
  - Built the final design using low-cost materials and presented it at the final competition to peers and faculty.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Skills Used**:  
  - SolidWorks, Arduino.

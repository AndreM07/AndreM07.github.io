# **About Me**

-I first became interested in engineering after I took my first engineering class in my freshman year of high school. It was an introductory engineering class where I learned the basics and foundations of engineering design.  

-I took 4 years of engineering classes in high school, with each course focusing on a specific branch of engineering, such as mechanical, electrical, and coding.  

-I was accepted to the University of Illinois Chicago, where I am pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering.  


-An additional interest of mine is finance. Here is a short list of finance books I've read: 

-The Buy Side
-Liar's Poker
-Den of Thieves
-A Short History of Financial Euphoria
-Barbarians at the Gate
-The Big Short
-The Predator's Ball

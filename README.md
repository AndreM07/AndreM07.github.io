# **About Me**

- I first became interested in engineering after I took my first engineering class in my freshman year of high school. It was an introductory engineering class where I learned the basics and foundations of engineering design.  

- I took 4 years of engineering classes in high school, with each course focusing on a specific branch of engineering, such as mechanical, electrical, and coding.  

- I was accepted to the University of Illinois Chicago, where I am pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering.  

- An additional interest of mine is finance. Here is a short list of finance books I've read:  

  - **The Buy Side**  
  - **Liar's Poker**  
  - **Den of Thieves**  
  - **A Short History of Financial Euphoria**  
  - **Barbarians at the Gate**  
  - **The Big Short**  
  - **The Predator's Ball**

# **Engineering Projects**

Here are some of the engineering projects I've worked on:  

### **1. SAE Wheel Hub Modeling** (2024-) 
- üå± **Description**:
- Modeling and optimizing an SAE wheel hub using ANSYS to ensure structural integrity and performance.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Skills Used**:
- ANSYS, Finite Element Analysis, SolidWorks.  

### **2. Ping Pong ball launcher**  (2022)
- üå± **Description**:  
-Collaborated with a team of four students to design and build an autonomous ping-pong ball
 launcher using Arduino.
-Utilized Solidworks to create individual 3-D component models and three final prototype
 assemblies.
-High-priority tasks were highlighted in a Gantt chart, and work was distributed evenly.
The final design was built from low-cost materials and presented in the final competition to
 peers and faculty 
- üõ†Ô∏è **Skills Used**: SolidWorks and Arduino.

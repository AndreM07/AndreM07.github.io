# **About Me**

- I developed an interest in engineering during my freshman year of high school after taking my first engineering class. This introductory course laid the foundation for my understanding of engineering design.  
- I completed 4 years of engineering courses in high school, each focusing on a different branch of engineering, including mechanical, electrical, and coding.  
- I am currently pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois Chicago.  
- Beyond engineering, I have a strong interest in finance. Below is a list of finance books I‚Äôve read:  
  - **The Buy Side**  
  - **Liar's Poker**  
  - **Den of Thieves**  
  - **A Short History of Financial Euphoria**  
  - **Barbarians at the Gate**  
  - **The Big Short**  
  - **The Predator's Ball**

# **Engineering Projects**

### **1. SAE Wheel Hub Modeling (2024‚ÄìPresent)**  
- üå± **Description**:  
  - Collaborating with a group of 5 Senior Design students to design and create an SAE wheel hub.  
  - Conducted patent research to explore and brainstorm potential designs.  
  - Used SolidWorks to create an original wheel hub design that meets SAE standards.  
  - Uploaded the design into ANSYS for Finite Element Analysis (FEA).  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Skills Used**:  
  - ANSYS, Finite Element Analysis, SolidWorks.  

### **2. Ping Pong Ball Launcher (2022)**  
- üå± **Description**:  
  - Worked with a team of four students to design and build an autonomous ping pong ball launcher using Arduino.  
  - Utilized SolidWorks to create 3D models for individual components and final prototypes.  
  - Created a Gantt chart to prioritize tasks and distribute the work evenly.  
  - Built the final design with low-cost materials and presented it at the final competition to peers and faculty.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Skills Used**:  
  - SolidWorks, Arduino.

# **About Me**

- I first became interested in engineering after taking my first engineering class during my freshman year of high school. It was an introductory engineering class where I learned the basics and foundations of engineering design.  
- I took 4 years of engineering classes in high school, each focusing on a specific branch of engineering, such as mechanical, electrical, and coding.  
- I was accepted to the University of Illinois Chicago, where I am pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering.  
- An additional interest of mine is finance. Here is a short list of finance books I've read:  
  - **The Buy Side**  
  - **Liar's Poker**  
  - **Den of Thieves**  
  - **A Short History of Financial Euphoria**  
  - **Barbarians at the Gate**  
  - **The Big Short**  
  - **The Predator's Ball**

# **Engineering Projects**

Here are some of the engineering projects I've worked on:  

### **1. SAE Wheel Hub Modeling** (2024‚Äì)  
- üå± **Description**:  
 - Currently working with a group of 5 Senior Design students to design & create a SAE wheel hub.
 - Conducted patent search to research and brainstorm possible designs
 - Utilized SolidWorks to create an original wheel hub design that meets SAE standards 
 - Uploaded design into ANSYS to apply FEA (Finite element analysis)

- üõ†Ô∏è **Skills Used**:  
  - ANSYS, Finite Element Analysis, SolidWorks.  

### **2. Ping Pong Ball Launcher** (2022)  
- üå± **Description**:  
  - Collaborated with a team of four students to design and build an autonomous ping-pong ball launcher using Arduino.  
  - Utilized SolidWorks to create individual 3D component models and three final prototype assemblies.  
  - Highlighted high-priority tasks in a Gantt chart, and work was distributed evenly.  
  - Built the final design using low-cost materials and presented it in the final competition to peers and faculty.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Skills Used**:  
  - SolidWorks, Arduino.
